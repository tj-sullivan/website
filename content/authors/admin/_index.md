I'm a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in Clinical Psychology at Stony Brook University, co-mentored by Dr. Dan O'Leary and Dr. Joanne Davila. My research spans the domains of stress, trauma, violence, close relationships, and LGBTQ+ stigma. Broadly, I seek to understand how adversity, trauma, and stigma can bring people in close relationships together or tear them apart. Because relationships are a key foundation to psychotherapy, I believe generating new knowledge in these areas is especially important for fine-tuning interventions to maximize therapeutic change. Before graduate school, I worked as a senior research assistant with Dr. John Pachankis at the Yale LGBTQ+ Mental Health Initiative in New York City. During my undergraduate years at Penn State, I worked with Dr. Amy Marshall and Dr. Louis Castonguay. To see more about me and my work, you can {{< staticref "uploads/cv.pdf" "newtab" >}} download my CV here{{< /staticref >}}. As my time permits, in the future I plan to contribute to the blog section of this website with posts focused on data analysis.
